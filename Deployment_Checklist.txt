Dynamic Port Binding - Heroku tells us which port our app will use, so we need to make sure we
                       listen to the port they tell us to
Specify Node Environment - We want to use a specific version of node, so we need to tell Heroku
                           Which version we want.
Specify start script - Instruct Heroku what command to run to start our server running.
Create .gitignore file - we don't want to include dependencies, Heroki will do that for us.
